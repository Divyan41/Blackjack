This is a BlackJack project 
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:

Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more without causing it to bust (exceed 21).
Gameplay:

The game is usually played with one or more decks of 52 cards.
Each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards: one face up and one face down (the hole card).
Players can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
Players can continue to hit until they choose to stand or until their hand value exceeds 21, resulting in a bust and an automatic loss.
After all players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals the hole card and plays their hand. The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.
Winning:

If a player's hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, the player wins and typically receives a payout of 1:1.
If a player gets a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) on the initial deal, they usually win 1.5 times their bet, unless the dealer also has a Blackjack, which results in a push (tie).
If the dealer busts, any remaining players win.
If both the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it is a push, and the player's bet is returned.
Additional Options:

Double Down: Players can choose to double their bet in exchange for committing to stand after receiving one more card.
Split: If a player's first two cards have the same value, they can split them into two separate hands, each with its own bet.
Insurance: If the dealer's face-up card is an Ace, players can take insurance, which is a side bet that the dealer has Blackjack. Insurance pays 2:1 if the dealer has a Blackjack.
Variations:

There are many variations of Blackjack, with slight differences in rules, such as the number of decks used, dealer hitting on a soft 17 (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11), and side bets.
These are the fundamental rules of Blackjack, but keep in mind that specific casinos or variations might have additional rules or differences. Always check the specific rules at the table where you are playing.
